# SwiftServe

SwiftServe is a lightweight and fast framework for building web applications and APIs using 
TypeScript and Node.js. It offers a clean and user-friendly API for developing applications 
with advanced support for HTTP and WebSocket.

# Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use SwiftServe to create an HTTP server that serves a basic HTML page:
page:
```
const createSwiftServe = require("swiftserve-pkg");
const app = createSwiftServe();

app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  // Middleware function to execute operations before handling requests
  await next();
});

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Hello, World!`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("ðŸš€ Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

# Key Features
